	Apatch
	   probably? Adaway compatible
	   hiding: none at all
	Magisk, magic mount
	   Adaway compatible
	   hiding: shamiko / denylist
	KernelSU, OverlayFS + path_umount
	   no adaway compatibiliy
	   hiding: umount modules, for non-gki please backport path_umount 

mode=1
     ksu_susfs bind mode, mount --bind
        KernelSU only
        Requires susfs-patched kernel and userspace tool
     Adaway compatible
     hiding, best in its class as susfs handles the unmount
     
mode=2
    plain bindhosts, mount --bind
       actually works on all managers but not really preferrable as it leaks that nasty global mount
    Adaway compatible
    hiding: none at all
    
mode=3
    apatch_hfr, hosts file redirect
       APatch only and requires hosts_file_redirect kpm
       https://github.com/AndroidPatch/kpm/blob/main/src/hosts_file_redirect/
       doesn't seem to work on all setups, hit-and-miss
       no adaway compatibility
     hiding, real good as theres no mount at all

mode=4
     zn_hostsredirect, zygisk netd injection
     Should work on all managers, requires 
       https://github.com/aviraxp/ZN-hostsredirect
       https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext
     no adaway compatibility
     hiding, real good as theres no mount at all
     
mode=5
    ksu_susfs_open_redirect, in-kernel file redirects
       KernelSU only
       Requires susfs-patched kernel and userspace tool
       No way to do heuristics? (citation needed) and author discourages its usage
       opt-in only due to lack of heuristic if krenel has it
         echo "mode=5" > /data/adb/bindhosts/mode_override.sh
       Requires susfs 1.5.1 or later
     Adaway compatible
     hiding, real good as theres no mount at all

mode=6
   ksu_source_mod
      KernelSU only
      requires source modification
        https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU/commit/2b2b0733d7c57324b742c017c302fc2c411fe0eb
      WARNING: conflicts with susfs, you dont need this if you can implement susfs
      opt-in only due to lack of heuristic if krenel has it
        echo "mode=6" > /data/adb/bindhosts/mode_override.sh
      Adaway compatible
      hiding, best in its class as long as path_umount is available
